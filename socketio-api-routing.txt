Socket IO API and routing

pushes are from server to client. They push to all clients, including the client
that initiated the change.

/****** API ******/

send:your-ip (server -> client) {ip}
// Tell server whether this client is room host
send:i-am-room-host (host-client -> server) {}
	sent in response to the your-ip event
send:join-room (client -> server) {room}
	sent in response to the your-ip event


/** Playlist control **/

// Push song info to client
push:queue (server -> client(s)) {queue_songs}

// Add Song
send:add-song (client -> server) {song}
push:add-song (server -> clients) {song}

// Remove Song
send:remove-song (host-client -> server) {id}

// Upvote Song
send:upvote (client -> server) {sid}
push:upvote (server -> clients) {song}

// Downvote Song
send:downvote (client -> server) {sid}
push:downvote (server -> clients) {song}


/** Music control with host-client **/

// Now Playing (also includes lastPlayed)
send:now-playing (host-client -> server) {song}
push:now-playing (server -> clients) {nowPlaying}

// Synchronize resumed time
send:resumed-time (host-client -> server) {resumedSeekPos, timeResumed}
	the host-client sends this in response to push:now-playing.

// Play
send:play (host-client -> server) {seekpos, timeResumed}
push:play (server -> clients) {seekpos, timeResumed}

// Pause
send:pause (host-client -> server) {seekpos}
push:pause (server -> clients) {seekpos}
